# List all containers (including stopped ones)
docker ps -a

# Run a container
docker run <image_name>

# Stop a running container
docker stop <container_id>

# Start a stopped container
docker start <container_id>

# Restart a container
docker restart <container_id>

# Remove a container
docker rm <container_id>

# View container logs
docker logs <container_id>

# Execute a command inside a running container
docker exec -it <container_id> <command>
```

## Image Management

Commands for handling Docker images:

```bash
# List Docker images
docker images

# Pull an image from Docker Hub
docker pull <image_name>

# Build an image from a Dockerfile
docker build -t <image_name>:<tag> <path>

# Remove a Docker image
docker rmi <image_id>

# Tag an image
docker tag <image_id> <new_image_name>:<tag>

# Push an image to a Docker registry
docker push <image_name>:<tag>
```

## Networking Commands

Commands to manage Docker networking:

```bash

docker network connect <network_name> <container_id>

# Disconnect a container from a network
docker network disconnect <network_name> <container_id>
```

## Docker Compose Commands

Common commands for managing multi-container applications with Docker Compose:

```bash
# Start services defined in docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up

# Start services in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# Stop services
docker-compose down

# View logs for services
docker-compose logs

# Scale services (e.g., run 3 instances of a service)
docker-compose up --scale <service_name>=<number>
```
